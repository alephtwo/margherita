# margherita
Get the most pizza for your money. Powered by React.js

# Usage
Fill in each row with information regarding pizzas that you are debating over. 
A theoretically infinite amount of rows can be added. 
Each row field and row performs its own error checking, so it will alert you if there are any issues with your input. 

margherita will calculate cost per square inch in real time and display the most effective use of your money with a green tint.
If there are two equivalent efficiencies, then both will be highlighted. 

# Acknowledgements
